            <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name's Jo. If you're interested in poetry, especially French poets, then have a look round my site. </p>
            <p>This is a fan girl site for Andree Chedid, a poet I knew nothing about a month ago. I'm going to use this portfolio project to collect some of her poems, thoughts and anything else I'm loving right now.</p>
            <p>Oh and yes, this site is also a dedication to Pantone colour of the year and I'm going to have some fun with colour but I'll try not to go overboard.
            <p>Andree Chedid famously said that her work was a quest for humanity.  I can't claim anything so noble but maybe this project will let me escape the matrix every now and then.will help me leave the matrix every once in a while

            <p>D'abord,<br>
                Efface ton nom<br>
                Abolis ton âge<br>
                Supprime tes lieux<br>
                Déracine ce que tu sembles<br>
                Qui reste debout ?<br>
                Maintenant,<br>
                Ressaisis ton nom<br>
                Revêts ton âge<br>
                Adopte ta maison<br>
                Pénètre ta marche<br>
                Et puis…<br>
                À n'en plus finir,<br>
                Recommence?</p>

            <h2>Who is Andree Chedid?</h2>   
            <p>As I said, a  month ago I knew nothing about this French poet. I hadn't even heard of it which is not hard because I'm pretty low brow. But I was searching for French female poets and her name came up.  She sounded cool so I thought I'd find out more.  I was also interested by her Syrian Lebanese Egyptian background.</p>
            <h2>Works</h2>
            <p>Andree Chedid was profilic, she wrote poetry, novels and theatre plays.  She was a celebrated poet in her lifetime in France and very popular with children.  Many French primary schools carry her name.</p>
