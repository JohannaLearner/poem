        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jo, I'm a web designer based in Cambridgeshire.</p>
        <p>I grew up in rural Huntingdonshire in the tiniest hamlet you can imagine.  Still a feudal community really as many of the houses were owned by the local aristocrary.</p>
        <p>I got away as soon as I could, Sheffield, Cambridge, Wimbledon and then my beloved Hackney</p>
        <p>We ended up back in Cambridgeshire in 2003 in a small market town.  We couldn't afford to live in Hackney and our tiny flat was getting cramped as our son grew older.</p>
        <p>It took us a while to acclimitise especially as my husband was a born and bred Londoner.  But We love it now, our town is friendly, welcoming, neighbourly.</p>
        
        <h3>About this site</h3>

        <p>It's an opportunity to find out a little more about French poetry.  I'd like to focus on female poets as much as I can.</p>
        <p>Why not get in touch if you can suggest some French poetesses (is that even a word?)</p>

        <h3>About Andree Chedid</h3>
                <p>Born Andree Saab in Cairo in 1920. She was of Libanaise, Egyptia, French nationality.  She was honoured in her lifetime with Prix Goncourt de la poesie and in 2009 Grand Officier de la Legion d'honneur</p>
                <p>Above all Andree Chedid was a humanist and her work centred on the human condition.  She was strongly opposed to violence and war.</p>
                <p>Andree celebrated life in her poetry but she also understood its precariousness.</p>
                <p>You can read more about her work and life on <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9e_Chedid">Wikipedia</a></p>
